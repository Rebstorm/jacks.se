# Code Reviews: Let's get real.
Code reviews are a crucial part of the software development process. They serve multiple purposes: they keep your team informed about changes, help catch bugs (though not all!), and add contextual depth to your code through comments and discussions.

However, they're not a panacea for all development woes. Code reviews are just one tool among many, not the entire basis of your quality control.

## What Code Reviews are not
In my experience, code reviews can sometimes devolve into a bulletin board for airing grievances. I've seen them used to generate an overwhelming list of follow-up tasks or even as a way to cherry-pick changes for a release branch‚Äîquite the misuse of their intent üò±. A code review should not be reduced to these functions.


## What Code Reviews Are (In Their Pure Essence)

At their core, code reviews are a straightforward list of changes made to the codebase. This simplicity is often overshadowed by other agendas, but it's essential to remember this foundational purpose.

## What Code Reviews Should Be

Ideally, code reviews should be a venue for receiving constructive feedback on your work. In a healthy team culture, they provide an opportunity not just to critique but also to describe and celebrate changes. They encourage a collaborative environment where knowledge sharing is as important as error correction.

### Building a Positive Code Review Culture
To maximize the benefits of code reviews, it's vital to foster a positive review culture. 

Here's a list I like to follow:

- **Encouraging empathy and respect**: Reviewers should approach comments with empathy and maintain a respectful tone. Remember, the goal is to improve the project, not to criticize the developer personally.

- **Being constructive, not destructive**: Feedback should be specific, actionable, and helpful, not vague or overly critical. This encourages growth and learning.

- **Promoting understanding**: Instead of just pointing out what‚Äôs wrong, explain why. This educational approach helps developers understand mistakes and learn from them.

- **Valuing all contribution**s: Recognize the efforts of your peers. Positive reinforcement can dramatically improve team morale and productivity.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Avoid these common mistakes to ensure your code reviews are effective and not a source of frustration:

- **Nitpicking**: Focus on substantial issues that impact the quality of the code, not stylistic preferences unless they violate a clearly specified coding standard.

- **Turnaround time**: Lengthy review processes can stall development. Aim for efficient, timely reviews to maintain momentum in the project lifecycle.

- **Inconsistency**: Apply the same standards to everyone, including senior team members. This consistency helps maintain fairness and credibility in the review process.


If you can stick to those 6 simple rules. I can guarantee a better code and working environment.
