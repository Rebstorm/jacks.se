# Jacks.se

[![Made with Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge-dark.svg)](https://fresh.deno.dev)

Welcome to my personal space on the web - Jacks.se! This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and yes, occasionally, my rants (welcome to the complain-o-sphere). Whether it's pondering life's mysteries or venting about day-to-day encounters, you'll find it here.

## Overview

Jacks.se is built with [specific technology/tools], designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring my musings are the star of the show. It's more than just a blog; it's a journey through my eyes.

## Features

- **Personal Blog:** Insightful articles, life lessons, and more.
- **Complain-o-Sphere:** A dedicated section for my rants and vents, all in good spirit, of course.
- **Interactive Engagement:** Readers can share their thoughts and feedback on posts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed on your computer. If you don't have Deno installed, you can find the installation instructions on the [official Deno website](https://deno.land/#installation).


### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/rebstorm/jacks.se.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd jacks.se
    ```

3. Start the project using the following Deno command. This will also watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
    ```
    deno task start
    ```

The blog should now be running locally on your machine!

### Usage

After executing the `deno task start`, the project will be live at a local server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`). Open your browser and interact with the blog as if you were a visitor, or make changes within the codebase and see them reflected live!
