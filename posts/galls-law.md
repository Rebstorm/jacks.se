# Gall's Law - We Devs Are the Issue


We developers, ever the architects of the abstract, often craft code that rivals a spider’s web in complexity and cunning. But, what if this inclination towards intricacy is our pitfall? Let’s explore why simplicity, encapsulated by Gall's Law, is crucial in developing effective systems.

## Understanding Gall’s Law

John Gall, an American author and pediatrician, established a principle known for its application far beyond the medical field: Gall’s Law. It states:

> "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.”

Gall’s Law underscores the idea that functional complexity evolves successfully only from simplicity. It cautions against overengineering solutions or aiming to build large, intricate systems without a foundation in something more straightforward and tried-and-true.

## The Pitfalls of Overengineering

At a glance, robust and complex solutions might seem advantageous, aiming to address every conceivable need or potentiality. However, overengineering often leads to several issues:

### **Increased Complexity and Cost:**
- More complex systems require more resources, including time, expertise, and money.

### **Diminished Flexibility:**
- Complex systems can become rigid, limiting the ability to adapt to changing needs or technologies.

### **Challenging Maintenance and Upgrades:**
- Ensuring stability and managing updates become more challenging as complexity increases.

### **User Unfriendliness:**
- Overly complex systems can be difficult for users to understand and operate, reducing accessibility and user adoption.

## Ugh, so what? How do I even avoid it?

While I can’t hold your hand, and it needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis, I have some general guidelines for you:

### **Start Small:**
- **Begin with the Core:** Identify and implement the core functionality that solves the primary problem or meets the most immediate need.
- **Minimize Initial Features:** Avoid the temptation to include every possible feature at the outset.

### **Iterative Development:**
- **Feedback Loop:** Employ a continuous feedback loop to understand user needs and issues.
- **Agile Practices:** Adopt an agile development approach, enabling you to introduce improvements and additional features incrementally.

### **User-Centered Design:**
- **Usability:** Ensure the solution is intuitive and addresses user pain points effectively.
- **User Experience:** Prioritize creating a positive and seamless user experience.

### **Scalability:**
- **Modularity:** Design systems to be modular, allowing for easy additions and alterations.
- **Gradual Expansion:** Expand and evolve the system gradually, ensuring stability at each stage.

## Sounds cool. Where can I read more?

If you're really into it, I suggest [The Systems Bible](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/583785). It is getting up there in age and can be a bit sluggish to read through. It also feels a little bit dated, especially when compared to the fast-paced lives of today’s Generation X.

It's important to note that Gall’s Law emphasizes a pathway of technological evolution that ascends from simplicity to complexity. It's not just a principle but a practice that has been illustrated in the journey of numerous successful organizations. By rooting development in simplicity, anchoring in user needs, and allowing systems to evolve, technologists and developers navigate a path that ensures stability, usability, and sustainable growth.

In this era of rapid technological advancements, keeping Gall's Law at the forefront of development practices provides a roadmap for creating resilient and effective systems that endure and adapt through time, never losing sight of the users they aim to serve.

Happy coding, you beautiful things ❤️
